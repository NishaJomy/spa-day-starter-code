Our application needs to do the following:

Display the user’s name and skin type under their customer profile.

Display the appropriate facial treatments for their skin type.

Display the description of the spa’s manicures or pedicures depending on the user’s interest
In controllers, we have one controller called SpaDayController. Inside SpaDayController, we have three methods.

The checkSkinType() method. The owners gave us this method to help us figure out which facial treatments are appropriate for which skin type.

The customerForm() method, which looks very similar to what we did in the last lesson.

The spaMenu() method, which we will use to bring in our Thymeleaf template, menu.html.
